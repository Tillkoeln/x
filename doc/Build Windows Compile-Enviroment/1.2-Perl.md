1.2 Install Perl:
--------------
a) http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.18.1.1800/ActivePerl-5.18.1.1800-MSWin32-x64-297570.msi

b) Run the installer ("Next", "Next", "Next", "Install", blah blah blah).  If it asks to make changes to your computer, say "Yes".
You can exclude Perl Script, PPM, documentation and examples if you don't need them for other purposes.
