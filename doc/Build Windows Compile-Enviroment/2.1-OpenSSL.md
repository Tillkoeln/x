2.1 Download OpenSSL: http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz

a) From a MinGw shell (that window we opened), unpack the source archive with tar (this will avoid symlink issues) then configure and make (one command per line):

			tar xvfz openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz

			cd openssl-1.0.1e

			Configure mingw

			make

Ta da!  You just compiled OpenSSL!

If it works it doesn't pat you on the back.  It just stops without saying "ERROR".  Welcome to software development.
