2.3 Boost: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/
--------------
Some of the coddling stops here.  If you've made it this far successfully, you don't need me to hold your hand.

a) Unpack boost inside your C:\deps folder.
b) Then open a command prompt (CMD.EXE), and:

		cd C:\deps\boost_1_55_0\

		bootstrap.bat mingw

		b2 --build-type=complete --with-chrono --with-filesystem --with-program_options --with-system --with-thread toolset=gcc stage

This will compile the required boost libraries and put them into the stage folder (C:\deps\boost_1_55_0\stage).
